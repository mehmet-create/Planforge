# Reusable view decorators for organization-level access control.

# Usage example:
#   @login_required
#   @org_member_required
#   def some_view(request, org_slug):
#
# Performance note:
# get_active_organization() caches its result on request._active_org_cache so
# the context processor (which runs later, inside render()) pays zero DB cost.
# Each decorator also caches the membership on request._membership_cache so
# multiple decorators stacked on one view don't re-query.
